# Chapter 19. Joins

# Introduction

It’s rare that a data analysis involves only a single data frame. Typically you have many data frames, and you must *join* them together to answer the questions that you’re interested in. This chapter will introduce you to two important types of joins:

- Mutating joins, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.
- Filtering joins, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether they match an observation in another.

We’ll begin by discussing keys, the variables used to connect a pair of data frames in a join. We cement the theory with an examination of the keys in the datasets from the nycflights13 package and then use that knowledge to start joining data frames together. Next we’ll discuss how joins work, focusing on their action on the rows. We’ll finish up with a discussion of non-equi joins, a family of joins that provide a more flexible way of matching keys than the default equality relationship.

## Prerequisites

In this chapter, we’ll explore the five related datasets from nycflights13 using the join functions from dplyr.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

# Keys

To understand joins, you need to first understand how two tables can be connected through a pair of keys, within each table. In this section, you’ll learn about the two types of key and see examples of both in the datasets of the nycflights13 package. You’ll also learn how to check that your keys are valid and what to do if your table lacks a key.

## Primary and Foreign Keys

Every join involves a pair of keys: a primary key and a foreign key. A *primary key* is a variable or set of variables that uniquely identifies each observation. When more than one variable is needed, the key is called a *compound key*. For example, in nycflights13:

- `airlines` records two pieces of data about each airline: its carrier code and its full name. You can identify an airline with its two-letter carrier code, making `carrier` the primary key.

  ```
  airlines
  #> # A tibble: 16 × 2
  #>   carrier name                    
  #>   <chr>   <chr>                   
  #> 1 9E      Endeavor Air Inc.       
  #> 2 AA      American Airlines Inc.  
  #> 3 AS      Alaska Airlines Inc.    
  #> 4 B6      JetBlue Airways         
  #> 5 DL      Delta Air Lines Inc.    
  #> 6 EV      ExpressJet Airlines Inc.
  #> # … with 10 more rows
  ```

- `airports` records data about each airport. You can identify each airport by its three-letter airport code, making `faa` the primary key.

  ```
  airports
  #> # A tibble: 1,458 × 8
  #>   faa   name                            lat   lon   alt    tz dst  
  #>   <chr> <chr>                         <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>
  #> 1 04G   Lansdowne Airport              41.1 -80.6  1044    -5 A    
  #> 2 06A   Moton Field Municipal Airport  32.5 -85.7   264    -6 A    
  #> 3 06C   Schaumburg Regional            42.0 -88.1   801    -6 A    
  #> 4 06N   Randall Airport                41.4 -74.4   523    -5 A    
  #> 5 09J   Jekyll Island Airport          31.1 -81.4    11    -5 A    
  #> 6 0A9   Elizabethton Municipal Airpo…  36.4 -82.2  1593    -5 A    
  #> # … with 1,452 more rows, and 1 more variable: tzone <chr>
  ```

- `planes` records data about each plane. You can identify a plane by its tail number, making `tailnum` the primary key.

  ```
  planes
  #> # A tibble: 3,322 × 9
  #>   tailnum  year type              manufacturer    model     engines
  #>   <chr>   <int> <chr>             <chr>           <chr>       <int>
  #> 1 N10156   2004 Fixed wing multi… EMBRAER         EMB-145XR       2
  #> 2 N102UW   1998 Fixed wing multi… AIRBUS INDUSTR… A320-214        2
  #> 3 N103US   1999 Fixed wing multi… AIRBUS INDUSTR… A320-214        2
  #> 4 N104UW   1999 Fixed wing multi… AIRBUS INDUSTR… A320-214        2
  #> 5 N10575   2002 Fixed wing multi… EMBRAER         EMB-145LR       2
  #> 6 N105UW   1999 Fixed wing multi… AIRBUS INDUSTR… A320-214        2
  #> # … with 3,316 more rows, and 3 more variables: seats <int>,
  #> #   speed <int>, engine <chr>
  ```

- `weather` records data about the weather at the origin airports. You can identify each observation by the combination of location and time, making `origin` and `time_hour` the compound primary key.

  ```
  weather
  #> # A tibble: 26,115 × 15
  #>   origin  year month   day  hour  temp  dewp humid wind_dir
  #>   <chr>  <int> <int> <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>
  #> 1 EWR     2013     1     1     1  39.0  26.1  59.4      270
  #> 2 EWR     2013     1     1     2  39.0  27.0  61.6      250
  #> 3 EWR     2013     1     1     3  39.0  28.0  64.4      240
  #> 4 EWR     2013     1     1     4  39.9  28.0  62.2      250
  #> 5 EWR     2013     1     1     5  39.0  28.0  64.4      260
  #> 6 EWR     2013     1     1     6  37.9  28.0  67.2      240
  #> # … with 26,109 more rows, and 6 more variables: wind_speed <dbl>,
  #> #   wind_gust <dbl>, precip <dbl>, pressure <dbl>, visib <dbl>, …
  ```

A *foreign key* is a variable (or set of variables) that corresponds to a primary key in another table. For example:

- `flights$tailnum` is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key `planes$tailnum`.
- `flights$carrier` is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key `airlines$carrier`.
- `flights$origin` is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key `airports$faa`.
- `flights$dest` is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key `airports$faa`.
- `flights$origin`-`flights$time_hour` is a compound foreign key that corresponds to the compound primary key `weather$origin`-`weather$time_hour`.

These relationships are summarized visually in <a href="#fig-flights-relationships" data-type="xref">Figure 19-1</a>.

<figure>
<img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1901.png" alt="The relationships between airports, planes, flights, weather, and airlines datasets from the nycflights13 package. airports$faa connected to the flights$origin and flights$dest. planes$tailnum is connected to the flights$tailnum. weather$time_hour and weather$origin are jointly connected to flights$time_hour and flights$origin. airlines$carrier is connected to flights$carrier. There are no direct connections between airports, planes, airlines, and weather data frames." />
<h6 id="figure-19-1.-connections-between-all-five-data-frames-in-the-nycflights13-package.-variables-making-up-a-primary-key-are-gray-and-are-connected-to-their-corresponding-foreign-keys-with-arrows.">Figure 19-1. Connections between all five data frames in the nycflights13 package. Variables making up a primary key are gray and are connected to their corresponding foreign keys with arrows.</h6>
</figure>

You’ll notice a nice feature in the design of these keys: the primary and foreign keys almost always have the same names, which, as you’ll see shortly, will make your joining life much easier. It’s also worth noting the opposite relationship: almost every variable name used in multiple tables has the same meaning in each place. There’s only one exception: `year` means year of departure in `flights` and year of manufacturer in `planes`. This will become important when we start actually joining tables together.

## Checking Primary Keys

Now that that we’ve identified the primary keys in each table, it’s good practice to verify that they do indeed uniquely identify each observation. One way to do that is to <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>count()</code></a> the primary keys and look for entries where `n` is greater than one. This reveals that `planes` and `weather` both look good:

```
planes |> 
  count(tailnum) |> 
  filter(n > 1)
#> # A tibble: 0 × 2
#> # … with 2 variables: tailnum <chr>, n <int>

weather |> 
  count(time_hour, origin) |> 
  filter(n > 1)
#> # A tibble: 0 × 3
#> # … with 3 variables: time_hour <dttm>, origin <chr>, n <int>
```

You should also check for missing values in your primary keys—if a value is missing, then it can’t identify an observation!

```
planes |> 
  filter(is.na(tailnum))
#> # A tibble: 0 × 9
#> # … with 9 variables: tailnum <chr>, year <int>, type <chr>,
#> #   manufacturer <chr>, model <chr>, engines <int>, seats <int>, …

weather |> 
  filter(is.na(time_hour) | is.na(origin))
#> # A tibble: 0 × 15
#> # … with 15 variables: origin <chr>, year <int>, month <int>, day <int>,
#> #   hour <int>, temp <dbl>, dewp <dbl>, humid <dbl>, wind_dir <dbl>, …
```

## Surrogate Keys

So far we haven’t talked about the primary key for `flights`. It’s not super important here, because there are no data frames that use it as a foreign key, but it’s still useful to consider because it’s easier to work with observations if we have some way to describe them to others.

After a little thinking and experimentation, we determined that there are three variables that together uniquely identify each flight:

```
flights |> 
  count(time_hour, carrier, flight) |> 
  filter(n > 1)
#> # A tibble: 0 × 4
#> # … with 4 variables: time_hour <dttm>, carrier <chr>, flight <int>, n <int>
```

Does the absence of duplicates automatically make `time_hour`-`carrier`-`flight` a primary key? It’s certainly a good start, but it doesn’t guarantee it. For example, are altitude and latitude a good primary key for `airports`?

```
airports |>
  count(alt, lat) |> 
  filter(n > 1)
#> # A tibble: 1 × 3
#>     alt   lat     n
#>   <dbl> <dbl> <int>
#> 1    13  40.6     2
```

Identifying an airport by its altitude and latitude is clearly a bad idea, and in general it’s not possible to know from the data alone whether a combination of variables makes a good primary key. But for flights, the combination of `time_hour`, `carrier`, and `flight` seems reasonable because it would be really confusing for an airline and its customers if there were multiple flights with the same flight number in the air at the same time.

That said, we might be better off introducing a simple numeric surrogate key using the row number:

```
flights2 <- flights |> 
  mutate(id = row_number(), .before = 1)
flights2
#> # A tibble: 336,776 × 20
#>      id  year month   day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time
#>   <int> <int> <int> <int>    <int>          <int>     <dbl>    <int>
#> 1     1  2013     1     1      517            515         2      830
#> 2     2  2013     1     1      533            529         4      850
#> 3     3  2013     1     1      542            540         2      923
#> 4     4  2013     1     1      544            545        -1     1004
#> 5     5  2013     1     1      554            600        -6      812
#> 6     6  2013     1     1      554            558        -4      740
#> # … with 336,770 more rows, and 12 more variables: sched_arr_time <int>,
#> #   arr_delay <dbl>, carrier <chr>, flight <int>, tailnum <chr>, …
```

Surrogate keys can be particularly useful when communicating to other humans: it’s much easier to tell someone to take a look at flight 2001 than to say look at UA430, which departed at 9 a.m. on January 3, 2013.

## Exercises

1.  We forgot to draw the relationship between `weather` and `airports` in <a href="#fig-flights-relationships" data-type="xref">Figure 19-1</a>. What is the relationship, and how should it appear in the diagram?

2.  `weather` contains information for only the three origin airports in NYC. If it contained weather records for all airports in the US, what additional connection would it make to `flights`?

3.  The `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin` variables almost form a compound key for `weather`, but there’s one hour that has duplicate observations. Can you figure out what’s special about that hour?

4.  We know that some days of the year are special and fewer people than usual fly on them (e.g., Christmas Eve and Christmas Day). How might you represent that data as a data frame? What would be the primary key? How would it connect to the existing data frames?

5.  Draw a diagram illustrating the connections between the `Batting`, `People`, and `Salaries` data frames in the Lahman package. Draw another diagram that shows the relationship between `People`, `Managers`, and `AwardsManagers`. How would you characterize the relationship between the `Batting`, `Pitching`, and `Fielding` data frames?

# Basic Joins

Now that you understand how data frames are connected via keys, we can start using joins to better understand the `flights` dataset. dplyr provides six join functions:

- <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>left_join()</code></a>
- <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>inner_join()</code></a>
- <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>right_join()</code></a>
- <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>full_join()</code></a>
- <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>semi_join()</code></a>
- <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>anti_join()</code></a>

They all have the same interface: they take a pair of data frames (`x` and `y`) and return a data frame. The order of the rows and columns in the output is primarily determined by `x`.

In this section, you’ll learn how to use one mutating join, <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>left_join()</code></a>, and two filtering joins, <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>semi_join()</code></a> and <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>anti_join()</code></a>. In the next section, you’ll learn exactly how these functions work and about the remaining <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>inner_join()</code></a>, <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>right_join()</code></a>, and <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>full_join()</code></a>.

## Mutating Joins

A *mutating join* allows you to combine variables from two data frames: it first matches observations by their keys and then copies across variables from one data frame to the other. Like <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>mutate()</code></a>, the join functions add variables to the right, so if your dataset has many variables, you won’t see the new ones. For these examples, we’ll make it easier to see what’s going on by creating a narrower dataset with just six variables:<sup><a href="ch19.html#idm44771284613936" id="idm44771284613936-marker" data-type="noteref">1</a></sup>

```
flights2 <- flights |> 
  select(year, time_hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2
#> # A tibble: 336,776 × 6
#>    year time_hour           origin dest  tailnum carrier
#>   <int> <dttm>              <chr>  <chr> <chr>   <chr>  
#> 1  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    IAH   N14228  UA     
#> 2  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 LGA    IAH   N24211  UA     
#> 3  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    MIA   N619AA  AA     
#> 4  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    BQN   N804JB  B6     
#> 5  2013 2013-01-01 06:00:00 LGA    ATL   N668DN  DL     
#> 6  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    ORD   N39463  UA     
#> # … with 336,770 more rows
```

There are four types of mutating join, but there’s one that you’ll use almost all of the time: <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>left_join()</code></a>. It’s special because the output will always have the same rows as `x`.<sup><a href="ch19.html#idm44771284529504" id="idm44771284529504-marker" data-type="noteref">2</a></sup> The primary use of <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>left_join()</code></a> is to add additional metadata. For example, we can use <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>left_join()</code></a> to add the full airline name to the `flights2` data:

```
flights2 |>
  left_join(airlines)
#> Joining with `by = join_by(carrier)`
#> # A tibble: 336,776 × 7
#>    year time_hour           origin dest  tailnum carrier name                
#>   <int> <dttm>              <chr>  <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>               
#> 1  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    IAH   N14228  UA      United Air Lines In…
#> 2  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 LGA    IAH   N24211  UA      United Air Lines In…
#> 3  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    MIA   N619AA  AA      American Airlines I…
#> 4  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    BQN   N804JB  B6      JetBlue Airways     
#> 5  2013 2013-01-01 06:00:00 LGA    ATL   N668DN  DL      Delta Air Lines Inc.
#> 6  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    ORD   N39463  UA      United Air Lines In…
#> # … with 336,770 more rows
```

Or we could find out the temperature and wind speed when each plane departed:

```
flights2 |> 
  left_join(weather |> select(origin, time_hour, temp, wind_speed))
#> Joining with `by = join_by(time_hour, origin)`
#> # A tibble: 336,776 × 8
#>    year time_hour           origin dest  tailnum carrier  temp wind_speed
#>   <int> <dttm>              <chr>  <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <dbl>      <dbl>
#> 1  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    IAH   N14228  UA       39.0       12.7
#> 2  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 LGA    IAH   N24211  UA       39.9       15.0
#> 3  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    MIA   N619AA  AA       39.0       15.0
#> 4  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    BQN   N804JB  B6       39.0       15.0
#> 5  2013 2013-01-01 06:00:00 LGA    ATL   N668DN  DL       39.9       16.1
#> 6  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    ORD   N39463  UA       39.0       12.7
#> # … with 336,770 more rows
```

Or what size of plane was flying:

```
flights2 |> 
  left_join(planes |> select(tailnum, type, engines, seats))
#> Joining with `by = join_by(tailnum)`
#> # A tibble: 336,776 × 9
#>    year time_hour           origin dest  tailnum carrier type                
#>   <int> <dttm>              <chr>  <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>               
#> 1  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    IAH   N14228  UA      Fixed wing multi en…
#> 2  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 LGA    IAH   N24211  UA      Fixed wing multi en…
#> 3  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    MIA   N619AA  AA      Fixed wing multi en…
#> 4  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    BQN   N804JB  B6      Fixed wing multi en…
#> 5  2013 2013-01-01 06:00:00 LGA    ATL   N668DN  DL      Fixed wing multi en…
#> 6  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    ORD   N39463  UA      Fixed wing multi en…
#> # … with 336,770 more rows, and 2 more variables: engines <int>, seats <int>
```

When <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>left_join()</code></a> fails to find a match for a row in `x`, it fills in the new variables with missing values. For example, there’s no information about the plane with tail number `N3ALAA` so the `type`, `engines`, and `seats` will be missing:

```
flights2 |> 
  filter(tailnum == "N3ALAA") |> 
  left_join(planes |> select(tailnum, type, engines, seats))

We’ll come back to this problem a few times in the rest of the chapter.

## Specifying Join Keys

By default, <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>left_join()</code></a> will use all variables that appear in both data frames as the join key, the so-called *natural* join. This is a useful heuristic, but it doesn’t always work. For example, what happens if we try to join `flights2` with the complete `planes` dataset?

```
flights2 |> 
  left_join(planes)
#> Joining with `by = join_by(year, tailnum)`
#> # A tibble: 336,776 × 13
#>    year time_hour           origin dest  tailnum carrier type  manufacturer
#>   <int> <dttm>              <chr>  <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <chr> <chr>       
#> 1  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    IAH   N14228  UA      <NA>  <NA>        
#> 2  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 LGA    IAH   N24211  UA      <NA>  <NA>        
#> 3  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    MIA   N619AA  AA      <NA>  <NA>        
#> 4  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    BQN   N804JB  B6      <NA>  <NA>        
#> 5  2013 2013-01-01 06:00:00 LGA    ATL   N668DN  DL      <NA>  <NA>        
#> 6  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    ORD   N39463  UA      <NA>  <NA>        
#> # … with 336,770 more rows, and 5 more variables: model <chr>,
#> #   engines <int>, seats <int>, speed <int>, engine <chr>
```

We get a lot of missing matches because our join is trying to use `tailnum` and `year` as a compound key. Both `flights` and `planes` have a `year` column, but they mean different things: `flights$year` is the year the flight occurred, and `planes$year` is the year the plane was built. We only want to join on `tailnum`, so we need to provide an explicit specification with <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join_by.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>join_by()</code></a>:

```
flights2 |> 
  left_join(planes, join_by(tailnum))
#> # A tibble: 336,776 × 14
#>   year.x time_hour           origin dest  tailnum carrier year.y
#>    <int> <dttm>              <chr>  <chr> <chr>   <chr>    <int>
#> 1   2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    IAH   N14228  UA        1999
#> 2   2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 LGA    IAH   N24211  UA        1998
#> 3   2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    MIA   N619AA  AA        1990
#> 4   2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    BQN   N804JB  B6        2012
#> 5   2013 2013-01-01 06:00:00 LGA    ATL   N668DN  DL        1991
#> 6   2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    ORD   N39463  UA        2012
#> # … with 336,770 more rows, and 7 more variables: type <chr>,
#> #   manufacturer <chr>, model <chr>, engines <int>, seats <int>, …
```

Note that the `year` variables are disambiguated in the output with a suffix (`year.x` and `year.y`), which tells you whether the variable came from the `x` or `y` argument. You can override the default suffixes with the `suffix` argument.

`join_by(tailnum)` is short for `join_by(tailnum == tailnum)`. It’s important to know about this fuller form for two reasons. First, it describes the relationship between the two tables: the keys must be equal. That’s why this type of join is often called an *equi join*. You’ll learn about non-equi joins in <a href="#sec-non-equi-joins" data-type="xref">“Filtering Joins”</a>.

Second, it’s how you specify different join keys in each table. For example, there are two ways to join the `flight2` and `airports` table: either by `dest` or by `origin`:

```
flights2 |> 
  left_join(airports, join_by(dest == faa))
#> # A tibble: 336,776 × 13
#>    year time_hour           origin dest  tailnum carrier name

#> # … with 336,770 more rows, and 6 more variables: lat <dbl>, lon <dbl>,
#> #   alt <dbl>, tz <dbl>, dst <chr>, tzone <chr>

flights2 |> 
  left_join(airports, join_by(origin == faa))
#> # A tibble: 336,776 × 13
#>    year time_hour           origin dest  tailnum carrier name               
#>   <int> <dttm>              <chr>  <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>              
#> 1  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    IAH   N14228  UA      Newark Liberty Intl
#> 2  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 LGA    IAH   N24211  UA      La Guardia         
#> 3  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    MIA   N619AA  AA      John F Kennedy Intl
#> 4  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 JFK    BQN   N804JB  B6      John F Kennedy Intl
#> 5  2013 2013-01-01 06:00:00 LGA    ATL   N668DN  DL      La Guardia         
#> 6  2013 2013-01-01 05:00:00 EWR    ORD   N39463  UA      Newark Liberty Intl
#> # … with 336,770 more rows, and 6 more variables: lat <dbl>, lon <dbl>,
#> #   alt <dbl>, tz <dbl>, dst <chr>, tzone <chr>
```

In older code you might see a different way of specifying the join keys, using a character vector:

- `by = "x"` corresponds to `join_by(x)`.
- `by = c("a" = "x")` corresponds to `join_by(a == x)`.

Now that it exists, we prefer <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join_by.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>join_by()</code></a> since it provides a clearer and more flexible specification.

<a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>inner_join()</code></a>, <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>right_join()</code></a>, and <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>full_join()</code></a> have the same interface as <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>left_join()</code></a>. The difference is which rows they keep: left join keeps all the rows in `x`, the right join keeps all rows in `y`, the full join keeps all rows in either `x` or `y`, and the inner join keeps only those rows that occur in both `x` and `y`. We’ll come back to these in more detail later.

## Filtering Joins

As you might guess, the primary action of a *filtering join* is to filter the rows. There are two types: semi-joins and anti-joins. *Semi-joins* keep all rows in `x` that have a match in `y`. For example, we could use a semi-join to filter the `airports` dataset to show just the origin airports:

```
airports |> 
  semi_join(flights2, join_by(faa == origin))
#> # A tibble: 3 × 8
#>   faa   name                  lat   lon   alt    tz dst   tzone           
#>   <chr> <chr>               <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr> <chr>           
#> 1 EWR   Newark Liberty Intl  40.7 -74.2    18    -5 A     America/New_York
#> 2 JFK   John F Kennedy Intl  40.6 -73.8    13    -5 A     America/New_York
#> 3 LGA   La Guardia           40.8 -73.9    22    -5 A     America/New_York
```

Or just the destinations:

```
airports |> 
  semi_join(flights2, join_by(faa == dest))
#> # A tibble: 101 × 8
#>   faa   name                     lat    lon   alt    tz dst   tzone          
#>   <chr> <chr>                  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr> <chr>          
#> 1 ABQ   Albuquerque Internati…  35.0 -107.   5355    -7 A     America/Denver 
#> 2 ACK   Nantucket Mem           41.3  -70.1    48    -5 A     America/New_Yo…
#> 3 ALB   Albany Intl             42.7  -73.8   285    -5 A     America/New_Yo…
#> 4 ANC   Ted Stevens Anchorage…  61.2 -150.    152    -9 A     America/Anchor…
#> 5 ATL   Hartsfield Jackson At…  33.6  -84.4  1026    -5 A     America/New_Yo…
#> 6 AUS   Austin Bergstrom Intl   30.2  -97.7   542    -6 A     America/Chicago
#> # … with 95 more rows
```

*Anti-joins* are the opposite: they return all rows in `x` that don’t have a match in `y`. They’re useful for finding missing values that are *implicit* in the data, the topic of <a href="ch18.html#sec-missing-implicit" data-type="xref">“Implicit Missing Values”</a>. Implicitly missing values don’t show up as `NA`s but instead exist only as an absence. For example, we can find rows that are missing from `airports` by looking for flights that don’t have a matching destination airport:

```
flights2 |> 
  anti_join(airports, join_by(dest == faa)) |> 
  distinct(dest)
#> # A tibble: 4 × 1
#>   dest 
#>   <chr>
#> 1 BQN  
#> 2 SJU  
#> 3 STT  
#> 4 PSE
```

Or we can find which `tailnum`s are missing from `planes`:

```
flights2 |>
  anti_join(planes, join_by(tailnum)) |> 
  distinct(tailnum)
#> # A tibble: 722 × 1
#>   tailnum
#>   <chr>  
#> 1 N3ALAA 
#> 2 N3DUAA 
#> 3 N542MQ 
#> 4 N730MQ 
#> 5 N9EAMQ 
#> 6 N532UA 
#> # … with 716 more rows
```

## Exercises

1.  Find the 48 hours (over the course of the whole year) that have the worst delays. Cross-reference it with the `weather` data. Can you see any patterns?

2.  Imagine you’ve found the top 10 most popular destinations using this code:

    ```
    top_dest <- flights2 |>
      count(dest, sort = TRUE) |>
      head(10)
    ```

    How can you find all flights to those destinations?

3.  Does every departing flight have corresponding weather data for that hour?

4.  What do the tail numbers that don’t have a matching record in `planes` have in common? (Hint: One variable explains about 90% of the problems.)

5.  Add a column to `planes` that lists every `carrier` that has flown that plane. You might expect that there’s an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Confirm or reject this hypothesis using the tools you’ve learned in previous chapters.

6.  Add the latitude and the longitude of the origin *and* destination airport to `flights`. Is it easier to rename the columns before or after the join?

7.  Compute the average delay by destination and then join on the `airports` data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:

    ```
    airports |>
      semi_join(flights, join_by(faa == dest)) |>
      ggplot(aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
        borders("state") +
        geom_point() +
        coord_quickmap()
    ```

    You might want to use the `size` or `color` of the points to display the average delay for each airport.

8.  What happened on June 13, 2013? Draw a map of the delays, and then use Google to cross-reference with the weather.

# How Do Joins Work?

Now that you’ve used joins a few times, it’s time to learn more about how they work, focusing on how each row in `x` matches rows in `y`. We’ll begin by introducing a visual representation of joins, using the simple tibbles defined next and shown in <a href="#fig-join-setup" data-type="xref">Figure 19-2</a>. In these examples we’ll use a single key called `key` and a single value column (`val_x` and `val_y`), but the ideas all generalize to multiple keys and multiple values.

```
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     3, "x3"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     4, "y3"
)
```

<figure>
<img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1902.png" alt="x and y are two data frames with 2 columns and 3 rows, with contents as described in the text. The values of the keys are colored: 1 is green, 2 is purple, 3 is orange, and 4 is yellow." />
<h6 id="figure-19-2.-graphical-representation-of-two-simple-tables.-the-colored-key-columns-map-background-color-to-key-value.-the-gray-columns-represent-the-value-columns-that-are-carried-along-for-the-ride.">Figure 19-2. Graphical representation of two simple tables. The colored <code>key</code> columns map background color to key value. The gray columns represent the “value” columns that are carried along for the ride.</h6>
</figure>

<a href="#fig-join-setup2" data-type="xref">Figure 19-3</a> introduces the foundation for our visual representation. It shows all potential matches between `x` and `y` as the intersection between lines drawn from each row of `x` and each row of `y`. The rows and columns in the output are primarily determined by `x`, so the `x` table is horizontal and lines up with the output.

<figure>
<img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1903.png" alt="x and y are placed at right-angles, with horizontal lines extending from x and vertical lines extending from y. There are 3 rows in x and 3 rows in y, which leads to nine intersections representing nine potential matches." />
<h6 id="figure-19-3.-to-understand-how-joins-work-its-useful-to-think-of-every-possible-match.-here-we-show-that-with-a-grid-of-connecting-lines.">Figure 19-3. To understand how joins work, it’s useful to think of every possible match. Here we show that with a grid of connecting lines.</h6>
</figure>

To describe a specific type of join, we indicate matches with dots. The matches determine the rows in the output, a new data frame that contains the key, the x values, and the y values. For example, <a href="#fig-join-inner" data-type="xref">Figure 19-4</a> shows an inner join, where rows are retained if and only if the keys are equal.

<figure>
<img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1904.png" alt="x and y are placed at right-angles with lines forming a grid of potential matches. Keys 1 and 2 appear in both x and y, so we get a match, indicated by a dot. Each dot corresponds to a row in the output, so the resulting joined data frame has two rows." />
<h6 id="figure-19-4.-an-inner-join-matches-each-row-in-x-to-the-row-in-y-that-has-the-same-value-of-key.-each-match-becomes-a-row-in-the-output.">Figure 19-4. An inner join matches each row in <code>x</code> to the row in <code>y</code> that has the same value of <code>key</code>. Each match becomes a row in the output.</h6>
</figure>

We can apply the same principles to explain the *outer joins*, which keep observations that appear in at least one of the data frames. These joins work by adding an additional “virtual” observation to each data frame. This observation has a key that matches if no other key matches, as well as values filled with `NA`. There are three types of outer joins:

- A *left join* keeps all observations in `x`, as shown in <a href="#fig-join-left" data-type="xref">Figure 19-5</a>. Every row of `x` is preserved in the output because it can fall back to matching a row of `NA`s in `y`.

  <figure>
  <img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1905.png" alt="Compared to the previous diagram showing an inner join, the y table gets a new virtual row contain in NA that will match any row in x that didn&#39;t otherwise match. This means that the output now has three rows. For key = 3, which matches this virtual row, val_y takes value NA." />
  <h6 id="figure-19-5.-a-visual-representation-of-the-left-join-where-every-row-in-x-appears-in-the-output.">Figure 19-5. A visual representation of the left join where every row in <code>x</code> appears in the output.</h6>
  </figure>

- A *right join* keeps all observations in `y`, as shown in <a href="#fig-join-right" data-type="xref">Figure 19-6</a>. Every row of `y` is preserved in the output because it can fall back to matching a row of `NA`s in `x`. The output still matches `x` as much as possible; any extra rows from `y` are added to the end.

  <figure>
  <img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1906.png" alt="Compared to the previous diagram showing an left join, the x table now gains a virtual row so that every row in y gets a match in x. val_x contains NA for the row in y that didn&#39;t match x." />
  <h6 id="figure-19-6.-a-visual-representation-of-the-right-join-where-every-row-of-y-appears-in-the-output.">Figure 19-6. A visual representation of the right join where every row of <code>y</code> appears in the output.</h6>
  </figure>

- A *full join* keeps all observations that appear in `x` or `y`, as shown in <a href="#fig-join-full" data-type="xref">Figure 19-7</a>. Every row of `x` and `y` is included in the output because both `x` and `y` have a fallback row of `NA`s. Again, the output starts with all rows from `x`, followed by the remaining unmatched `y` rows.

  <figure>
  <img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1907.png" alt="Now both x and y have a virtual row that always matches. The result has 4 rows: keys 1, 2, 3, and 4 with all values from val_x and val_y, however key 2, val_y and key 4, val_x are NAs since those keys don&#39;t have a match in the other data frames." />
  <h6 id="figure-19-7.-a-visual-representation-of-the-full-join-where-every-row-in-x-and-y-appears-in-the-output.">Figure 19-7. A visual representation of the full join where every row in <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> appears in the output.</h6>
  </figure>

Another way to show how the types of outer join differ is with a Venn diagram, as in <a href="#fig-join-venn" data-type="xref">Figure 19-8</a>. However, this is not a great representation because while it might jog your memory about which rows are preserved, it fails to illustrate what’s happening with the columns.

<figure>
<img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1908.png" alt="Venn diagrams for inner, full, left, and right joins. Each join represented with two intersecting circles representing data frames x and y, with x on the right and y on the left. Shading indicates the result of the join." />
<h6 id="figure-19-8.-venn-diagrams-showing-the-difference-between-inner-left-right-and-full-joins.">Figure 19-8. Venn diagrams showing the difference between inner, left, right, and full joins.</h6>
</figure>

The joins shown here are the so-called *equi joins*, where rows match if the keys are equal. Equi joins are the most common type of join, so we’ll typically omit the equi prefix and just say “inner join” rather than “equi inner join.” We’ll come back to non-equi joins in <a href="#sec-non-equi-joins" data-type="xref">“Filtering Joins”</a>.

## Row Matching

So far we’ve explored what happens if a row in `x` matches zero or one rows in `y`. What happens if it matches more than one row? To understand what’s going on, let’s first narrow our focus to <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>inner_join()</code></a> and then draw a picture, as shown in <a href="#fig-join-match-types" data-type="xref">Figure 19-9</a>.

Note that while there are three rows in <code>x</code> and three rows in the output, there isn’t a direct correspondence between the rows.</h6>
</figure>

There are three possible outcomes for a row in `x`:

- If it doesn’t match anything, it’s dropped.
- If it matches one row in `y`, it’s preserved.
- If it matches more than one row in `y`, it’s duplicated once for each match.

In principle, this means there’s no guaranteed correspondence between the rows in the output and the rows in `x`, but in practice, this rarely causes problems. There is, however, one particularly dangerous case that can cause a combinatorial explosion of rows. Imagine joining the following two tables:

```
df1 <- tibble(key = c(1, 2, 2), val_x = c("x1", "x2", "x3"))
df2 <- tibble(key = c(1, 2, 2), val_y = c("y1", "y2", "y3"))
```

While the first row in `df1` matches only one row in `df2`, the second and third rows both match two rows. This is sometimes called a *many-to-many* join and will cause dplyr to emit a warning:

```
df1 |> 
  inner_join(df2, join_by(key))
#> Warning in inner_join(df1, df2, join_by(key)): 
#> Detected an unexpected many-to-many relationship between `x` and `y`.
#> ℹ Row 2 of `x` matches multiple rows in `y`.
#> ℹ Row 2 of `y` matches multiple rows in `x`.
#> ℹ If a many-to-many relationship is expected, set `relationship =
#>   "many-to-many"` to silence this warning.
#> # A tibble: 5 × 3
#>     key val_x val_y
#>   <dbl> <chr> <chr>
#> 1     1 x1    y1   
#> 2     2 x2    y2   
#> 3     2 x2    y3   
#> 4     2 x3    y2   
#> 5     2 x3    y3
```

If you are doing this deliberately, you can set `relationship = "many-to-many"`, as the warning suggests.

## Filtering Joins

The number of matches also determines the behavior of the filtering joins. The semi-join keeps rows in `x` that have one or more matches in `y`, as in <a href="#fig-join-semi" data-type="xref">Figure 19-10</a>. The anti-join keeps rows in `x` that match zero rows in `y`, as in <a href="#fig-join-anti" data-type="xref">Figure 19-11</a>. In both cases, only the existence of a match is important; it doesn’t matter how many times it matches. This means that filtering joins never duplicate rows like mutating joins do.

# Non-Equi Joins

So far you’ve seen only equi joins, joins where the rows match if the `x` key equals the `y` key. Now we’re going to relax that restriction and discuss other ways of determining if a pair of rows match.

But before we can do that, we need to revisit a simplification we made previously. In equi joins the `x` keys and `y` are always equal, so we need to show only one in the output. We can request that dplyr keep both keys with `keep = TRUE`, leading to the following code and the redrawn <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>inner_join()</code></a> in <a href="#fig-inner-both" data-type="xref">Figure 19-12</a>.

```
x |> left_join(y, by = "key", keep = TRUE)
#> # A tibble: 3 × 4
#>   key.x val_x key.y val_y
#>   <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <chr>
#> 1     1 x1        1 y1   
#> 2     2 x2        2 y2   
#> 3     3 x3       NA <NA>
```

<figure>
<img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1912.png" alt="A join diagram showing an inner join between x and y. The result now includes four columns: key.x, val_x, key.y, and val_y. The values of key.x and key.y are identical, which is why we usually only show one. " />
<h6 id="figure-19-12.-an-inner-join-showing-both-x-and-y-keys-in-the-output.">Figure 19-12. An inner join showing both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> keys in the output.</h6>
</figure>

When we move away from equi joins, we’ll always show the keys, because the key values will often be different. For example, instead of matching only when the `x$key` and `y$key` are equal, we could match whenever the `x$key` is greater than or equal to the `y$key`, leading to <a href="#fig-join-gte" data-type="xref">Figure 19-13</a>. dplyr’s join functions understand this distinction between equi and non-equi joins so will always show both keys when you perform a non-equi join.

</figure>

Non-equi join isn’t a particularly useful term because it only tells you what the join is not, not what it is. dplyr helps by identifying four particularly useful types of non-equi join:

Cross joins  
Match every pair of rows.

Inequality joins  
Use `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` instead of `==`.

Rolling joins  
Similar to inequality joins but only find the closest match.

Overlap joins  
A special type of inequality join designed to work with ranges.

Each of these is described in more detail in the following sections.

## Cross Joins

A cross join matches everything, as in <a href="#fig-join-cross" data-type="xref">Figure 19-14</a>, generating the Cartesian product of rows. This means the output will have `nrow(x) * nrow(y)` rows.

<figure>
<img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1914.png" alt="A join diagram showing a dot for every combination of x and y." />
<h6 id="figure-19-14.-a-cross-join-matches-each-row-in-x-with-every-row-in-y.">Figure 19-14. A cross join matches each row in <code>x</code> with every row in <code>y</code>.</h6>
</figure>

Cross joins are useful when generating permutations. For example, the following code generates every possible pair of names. Since we’re joining `df` to itself, this is sometimes called a *self-join*. Cross joins use a different join function because there’s no distinction between inner/left/right/full when you’re matching every row.

```
df <- tibble(name = c("John", "Simon", "Tracy", "Max"))
df |> cross_join(df)
#> # A tibble: 16 × 2
#>   name.x name.y
#>   <chr>  <chr> 
#> 1 John   John  
#> 2 John   Simon 
#> 3 John   Tracy 
#> 4 John   Max   
#> 5 Simon  John  
#> 6 Simon  Simon 
#> # … with 10 more rows
```

## Inequality Joins

Inequality joins use `<`, `<=`, `>=`, or `>` to restrict the set of possible matches, as in <a href="#fig-join-gte" data-type="xref">Figure 19-13</a> and <a href="#fig-join-lt" data-type="xref">Figure 19-15</a>.

<figure>
<img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1915.png" alt="A diagram depicting an inequality join where a data frame x is joined by a data frame y where the key of x is less than the key of y, resulting in a triangular shape in the top-left corner." />
<h6 id="figure-19-15.-an-inequality-join-where-x-is-joined-to-y-on-rows-where-the-key-of-x-is-less-than-the-key-of-y.-this-makes-a-triangular-shape-in-the-top-left-corner.">Figure 19-15. An inequality join where <code>x</code> is joined to <code>y</code> on rows where the key of <code>x</code> is less than the key of <code>y</code>. This makes a triangular shape in the top-left corner.</h6>
</figure>

Inequality joins are extremely general, so general that it’s hard to come up with meaningful specific use cases. One small useful technique is to use them to restrict the cross join so that instead of generating all permutations, we generate all combinations:

```
df <- tibble(id = 1:4, name = c("John", "Simon", "Tracy", "Max"))

df |> left_join(df, join_by(id < id))
#> # A tibble: 7 × 4
#>    id.x name.x  id.y name.y
#>   <int> <chr>  <int> <chr> 
#> 1     1 John       2 Simon 
#> 2     1 John       3 Tracy 
#> 3     1 John       4 Max   
#> 4     2 Simon      3 Tracy 
#> 5     2 Simon      4 Max   
#> 6     3 Tracy      4 Max   
#> # … with 1 more row
```

## Rolling Joins

Rolling joins are a special type of inequality join where instead of getting *every* row that satisfies the inequality, you get just the closest row, as in <a href="#fig-join-closest" data-type="xref">Figure 19-16</a>. You can turn any inequality join into a rolling join by adding `closest()`. For example, `join_by(closest(x <= y))` matches the smallest `y` that’s greater than or equal to x, and `join_by(closest(x > y))` matches the biggest `y` that’s less than `x`.

<figure>
<img src="D:\sd\Practices\any2md\output\[2023] R for Data Science/assets/rds2_1916.png" alt="A rolling join is a subset of an inequality join so some matches are grayed out indicating that they&#39;re not used because they&#39;re not the &quot;closest&quot;." />
<h6 id="figure-19-16.-a-rolling-join-is-similar-to-a-greater-than-or-equal-inequality-join-but-matches-only-the-first-value.">Figure 19-16. A rolling join is similar to a greater-than-or-equal inequality join but matches only the first value.</h6>
</figure>

Rolling joins are particularly useful when you have two tables of dates that don’t perfectly line up and you want to find, for example, the closest date in table 1 that comes before (or after) some date in table 2.

For example, imagine that you’re in charge of the party planning commission for your office. Your company is rather cheap so instead of having individual parties, you have a party only once each quarter. The rules for determining when a party will be held are a little complex: parties are always on a Monday, you skip the first week of January since a lot of people are on holiday, and the first Monday of Q3 2022 is July 4, so that has to be pushed back a week. That leads to the following party days:

```
parties <- tibble(
  q = 1:4,
  party = ymd(c("2022-01-10", "2022-04-04", "2022-07-11", "2022-10-03"))
)
```

Now imagine that you have a table of employee birthdays:

```
employees <- tibble(
  name = sample(babynames::babynames$name, 100),
  birthday = ymd("2022-01-01") + (sample(365, 100, replace = TRUE) - 1)
)
employees
#> # A tibble: 100 × 2
#>   name    birthday  
#>   <chr>   <date>    
#> 1 Case    2022-09-13
#> 2 Shonnie 2022-03-30
#> 3 Burnard 2022-01-10
#> 4 Omer    2022-11-25
#> 5 Hillel  2022-07-30
#> 6 Curlie  2022-12-11
#> # … with 94 more rows
```

And for each employee we want to find the first party date that comes after (or on) their birthday. We can express that with a rolling join:

```
employees |> 
  left_join(parties, join_by(closest(birthday >= party)))
#> # A tibble: 100 × 4
#>   name    birthday       q party     
#>   <chr>   <date>     <int> <date>    
#> 1 Case    2022-09-13     3 2022-07-11
#> 2 Shonnie 2022-03-30     1 2022-01-10
#> 3 Burnard 2022-01-10     1 2022-01-10
#> 4 Omer    2022-11-25     4 2022-10-03
#> 5 Hillel  2022-07-30     3 2022-07-11
#> 6 Curlie  2022-12-11     4 2022-10-03
#> # … with 94 more rows
```

There is, however, one problem with this approach: the folks with birthdays before January 10 don’t get a party:

```
employees |> 
  anti_join(parties, join_by(closest(birthday >= party)))
#> # A tibble: 0 × 2
#> # … with 2 variables: name <chr>, birthday <date>
```

To resolve that issue we’ll need to tackle the problem a different way, with overlap joins.

## Overlap Joins

Overlap joins provide three helpers that use inequality joins to make it easier to work with intervals:

- `between(x, y_lower, y_upper)` is short for `x >= y_lower, x <= y_upper`.
- `within(x_lower, x_upper, y_lower, y_upper)` is short for `x_lower >= y_lower, x_upper <= y_upper`.
- `overlaps(x_lower, x_upper, y_lower, y_upper)` is short for `x_lower <= y_upper, x_upper >= y_lower`.

Let’s continue the birthday example to see how you might use them. There’s one problem with the strategy we used earlier: there’s no party preceding the birthdays from January 1 to 9. So it might be better to to be explicit about the date ranges that each party span, and make a special case for those early birthdays:

```
parties <- tibble(
  q = 1:4,
  party = ymd(c("2022-01-10", "2022-04-04", "2022-07-11", "2022-10-03")),
  start = ymd(c("2022-01-01", "2022-04-04", "2022-07-11", "2022-10-03")),
  end = ymd(c("2022-04-03", "2022-07-11", "2022-10-02", "2022-12-31"))
)
parties
#> # A tibble: 4 × 4
#>       q party      start      end       
#>   <int> <date>     <date>     <date>    
#> 1     1 2022-01-10 2022-01-01 2022-04-03
#> 2     2 2022-04-04 2022-04-04 2022-07-11
#> 3     3 2022-07-11 2022-07-11 2022-10-02
#> 4     4 2022-10-03 2022-10-03 2022-12-31
```

Hadley is hopelessly bad at data entry, so he also wanted to check that the party periods don’t overlap. One way to do this is by using a self-join to check whether any start-end interval overlaps with another:

```
parties |> 
  inner_join(parties, join_by(overlaps(start, end, start, end), q < q)) |> 
  select(start.x, end.x, start.y, end.y)
#> # A tibble: 1 × 4
#>   start.x    end.x      start.y    end.y     
#>   <date>     <date>     <date>     <date>    
#> 1 2022-04-04 2022-07-11 2022-07-11 2022-10-02
```

Oops, there is an overlap, so let’s fix that problem and continue:

```
parties <- tibble(
  q = 1:4,
  party = ymd(c("2022-01-10", "2022-04-04", "2022-07-11", "2022-10-03")),
  start = ymd(c("2022-01-01", "2022-04-04", "2022-07-11", "2022-10-03")),
  end = ymd(c("2022-04-03", "2022-07-10", "2022-10-02", "2022-12-31"))
)
```

Now we can match each employee to their party. This is a good place to use `unmatched = "error"` because we want to quickly find out if any employees didn’t get assigned a party:

```
employees |> 
  inner_join(parties, join_by(between(birthday, start, end)), unmatched = "error")
#> # A tibble: 100 × 6
#>   name    birthday       q party      start      end       
#>   <chr>   <date>     <int> <date>     <date>     <date>    
#> 1 Case    2022-09-13     3 2022-07-11 2022-07-11 2022-10-02
#> 2 Shonnie 2022-03-30     1 2022-01-10 2022-01-01 2022-04-03
#> 3 Burnard 2022-01-10     1 2022-01-10 2022-01-01 2022-04-03
#> 4 Omer    2022-11-25     4 2022-10-03 2022-10-03 2022-12-31
#> 5 Hillel  2022-07-30     3 2022-07-11 2022-07-11 2022-10-02
#> 6 Curlie  2022-12-11     4 2022-10-03 2022-10-03 2022-12-31
#> # … with 94 more rows
```

## Exercises

1.  Can you explain what’s happening with the keys in this equi join? Why are they different?

    ```
    x |> full_join(y, by = "key")
    #> # A tibble: 4 × 3
    #>     key val_x val_y
    #>   <dbl> <chr> <chr>
    #> 1     1 x1    y1   
    #> 2     2 x2    y2   
    #> 3     3 x3    <NA> 
    #> 4     4 <NA>  y3

    x |> full_join(y, by = "key", keep = TRUE)
    #> # A tibble: 4 × 4
    #>   key.x val_x key.y val_y
    #>   <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <chr>
    #> 1     1 x1        1 y1   
    #> 2     2 x2        2 y2   
    #> 3     3 x3       NA <NA> 
    #> 4    NA <NA>      4 y3
    ```

2.  When finding if any party period overlapped with another party period, we used `q < q` in the <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join_by.html" class="orm:hideurl"><code>join_by()</code></a>? Why? What happens if you remove this inequality?

# Summary

In this chapter, you learned how to use mutating and filtering joins to combine data from a pair of data frames. Along the way you learned how to identify keys, and you learned the difference between primary and foreign keys. You also understand how joins work and how to figure out how many rows the output will have. Finally, you gained a glimpse into the power of non-equi joins and saw a few interesting use cases.

This chapter concludes the “Transform” part of the book where the focus was on the tools you could use with individual columns and tibbles. You learned about dplyr and base functions for working with logical vectors, numbers, and complete tables; stringr functions for working strings; lubridate functions for working with date-times; and forcats functions for working with factors.

In the next part of the book, you’ll learn more about getting various types of data into R in a tidy form.
